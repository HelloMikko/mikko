Below is a list of Markdown Emoji's


{{< admonition warning >}}
Take note that **if** some emoji's starts and like `:rage3:` and ends with the same like `:rage3:`, this means that the emoji does not work with markdown `.md` right out of the box.

If you would like to add themes to your markdown, there are some recommendations and suggestions:
- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/0.15.2//)
  
which will to help get you started.

Personally, my favorite is Material for MKDocs if you would ask me. 😄 However, what you see below are most of what actually works with Markdown itself and has been tested by me. You can also check out my Gist as well if you want to save it yourself within your Github/Gist  https://reflinked.mikko.codes/ov0
